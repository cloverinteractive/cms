However you can use `clovercms` with JRuby by doing the following:\r\n\r\n0. `rm -f Gemfile.lock`\r\n1. `jruby -S bundle install`\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nFeel free to submit a pull request and don't forget to add your name to the list below.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Enrique Vidal](http://github.com/EnriqueVidal)\r\n* [Adan Alvarado](http://github.com/aalvarado)\r\n* [ulisesroche](http://github.com/ulisesroche)\r\n","tagline":"Rails 3.2 simple CMS","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
